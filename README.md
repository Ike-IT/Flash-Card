# Flash-Card
The flash card project is basically for learning the frequently used words in any language.
At the moment the project only translate from English to French.
The card flips every 3 seconds to show the English meaning of any French word displayed.
It has a functions that allows the user to skip the French words he/she knows and also repeat the ones the user does not know yet.
When a user skips a word, that word never gets displayed again because it is assumed the user already knows that word and words not skipped goes back into the deck.
