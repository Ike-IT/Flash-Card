# Flash-Card
The flash card project is basically for learning the frequently used words in any language.
At the moment the project only translate from English to French.
The front card displays a word in French and the back displays the meaning in English.
The flash card picks and displays a random French word and flips every 3 seconds to show the English meaning.
It has a functions that allows the user to skip the French words the user knows and also repeat the ones the user does not know yet.
When a user skips a word, that word never gets displayed again because it is assumed the user already knows that word and words not skipped goes back into the deck.
